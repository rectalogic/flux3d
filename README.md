# FLUX to 3D

Enter text to generate an image of an object against a black background using [FLUX.1-schnell](https://huggingface.co/spaces/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell),
then turn that image into a 3D object rendered using [TRELLIS](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JeffreyXiang/TRELLIS) rendered with [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

This is using HuggingFace spaces via [Gradio Client API](https://www.gradio.app/docs/js-client).
